# Data-Structures-in-C-
# This Project was created by Haralambos Kokkinakos in Anjuta. 
# The .cc files in the src folder are the classes and programs written and they require the .h files to link.
# All the other files are created by the Anjuta compiler in order for it to run.
# Import the whole project and run the main file to execute the program.
